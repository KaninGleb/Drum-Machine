## :scroll:Description

**Drum Machime** is a responsive and interactive web application built as part of the FreeCodeCamp Front End Development Libraries certification. It features nine drum pads, each mapped to a unique keyboard key (Q, W, E, A, S, D, Z, X, C), allowing users to play different drum sounds by clicking the pads or pressing the corresponding keys. The app displays the name of the sound currently being played and includes a volume control slider for adjusting playback volume dynamically. Developed with React and CSS modules, this project demonstrates handling of keyboard events, audio playback control, and state management to create an engaging user experience that meets all FreeCodeCamp user stories for the drum machine project.
